.TH CURLOPT_NOBODY 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_NOBODY \- do the download request without getting the body
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_NOBODY, long opt);
.SH DESCRIPTION
A long parameter set to 1 tells libcurl to not include the body-part in the
output when doing what would otherwise be a download. For HTTP(S), this makes
libcurl do a HEAD request. For most other protocols it means just not asking
to transfer the body data.

Enabling this option means asking for a download but without a body.
.SH DEFAULT
0, the body is transferred
.SH PROTOCOLS
Most
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com");

  /* get us the resource without a body! */ 
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 1L);

  /* Perform the request */ 
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
