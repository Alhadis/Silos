.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm gdp-create
creates a new GDP object
(sometimes called a
.Ql "log"
or a
.Ql "Data Capsule" ,
mostly for historic reasons)
on a given log server.
In its default mode it also creates a public/secret
.Ql "owner"
keypair associated with this object,
with the public key stored in the object metadata.
Additional (text-based) metadata can be added
(arguably this should allow binary metadata as well).
Optionally the log can be given a human-understandable name;
if not specified a seemingly random name is made up.
.
.Ss "Metadata"
User-specified metadata may be added when a log is created.
The metadata name is stored as a 32-bit number and is generally represented
by four characters.
.Pp
In addition to user metadata,
.Nm gdp-create
adds metadata for the log creation time,
the public half of the signing key in DER format,
and the human-readable name.
.Pp
Metadata is immutable; there is no way to add, delete, or change metadata
after the log is created.
.
.Ss "Key Management"
GDP objects may have two secret keys associated with them:
the
.Ql owner
key allows administrative control over the object and the
.Ql writer
key allows write access to the object.
If the writer key is not specifies it defaults to the same as the owner key.
.
.Ss "Warning"
This implementation will change in the future,
and the command will probably be subsumed into a swarm service.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.
.It Fl C
Sets the name of the creator in the log metadata.
If this is not specified it will be derived from system data.
It should be in the form of an email address.
.
.It Fl D Ar debug-spec
Turns on debugging flags using the libep-style format.
Useful only with the code in hand.
.
.It Fl e Ar key-crypto
Specifies symmetric encryption algorithm to use for storing the secret key.
If
.Ar key-crypto
is
.Li none
then the key is stored unencrypted on disk.
Defaults to
.Va swarm.gdp.crypto.keyenc.alg .
.
.It Fl G Ar router-ip
Contact the given IP address (which may be a DNS name)
to get a connection to the GDP routing layer.
This will be replaced by automatic discovery
(for example, using Zeroconf)
soon.
The address may have an optional port number after a colon.
If this is not specified,
the names listed in the
.Va swarm.gdp.routers
runtime administrative parameter
are searched.
.
.It Fl h Ar hash-alg
Selects the hash (message digest) algorithm used when
generating and checking signatures.
When data is appended to the log,
the log name, log metadata, record number, and record data
is hashed using this algorithm and then that hash is signed.
.
.It Fl k Ar key-type
Selects the type of signing key to be created for this log.
It can be one of
.Li rsa ,
.Li dsa ,
or
.Li ec .
As a special case, the type
.Li none
suppresses creation of the keypair.
.
.It Fl K Ar owner-key-location
This option has two purposes.
First, if you want to use an existing keypair
(formatted as a PEM file)
as the owner key
you can use the
.Fl K
flag to name an existing PEM file.
If you want
.Nm
to create a keypair for you,
.Fl K
can name either a file in which to store the secret key,
or a directory into which the secret key will be written
named the same as the internal name of the log (with
.Va \&-owner.pem
appended).
If
.Fl K
is not specified, the value of the
.Va swarm.gdp.crypto.key.dir
administrative parameter will be used
as a colon-separated directory search path,
which defaults to
.Pa ./KEYS ,
or to the current directory if the
.Pa KEYS
directory does not exist.
.
.It Fl b Ar key-bits
If the key type is RSA or DSA,
this parameter specifies the number of bits in the key.
If this is omitted and the key type is RSA,
this defaults to the value of
.Va swarm.gdp.crypto.rsa.keylen .
DSA keys use
.Va swarm.gdp.crypto.dsa.keylen .
Additionally, RSA keys use the
.Va swarm.gdp.crypto.rsa.keyexp
parameter to set the exponent.
This parameter is ignored when creating EC key pairs.
.
.It Fl c Ar curve-name
Sets the name of the curve to use for Elliptic Cryptography keys.
This overrides the
.Va swarm.gdp.crypto.ec.curve
parameter.
Ignored when creating RSA or DSA key pairs.
.
.It Fl q
If set,
.Nm
does not show errors or informational message.
In particular, using
.Fl q
is a way to ensure that a log exists without give an error if it already exists.
.
.It Fl s Ar logd-gdp-addr
The name of the log daemon on which to create the physical instantiation
of the log.
If not specified, the value of the
.Va swarm.gdp.gdp-create.server
administrative will be used.
If that is not set,
it will default to one of the servers at Berkeley.
If you want a specific server at your site,
either use the
.Fl s
flag or set that administrative parameter.
.
.It Fl S
Skips the test to see if the log already exists before creating it.
Used for debugging.
.
.It Fl W Ar writer-key-location
Similar to
.Fl K ,
but for the writer key.
If this is not specified, the writer key is the same as the owner key.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Bl -tag
.It Li EX_OK No (0)
Success
.It Li EX_CANTCREAT No (73)
The log already exists.
.It Li EX_DATAERR No (65)
A command-line key file could not be parsed.
.It Li EX_IOERR No (74)
A secret key file could not be created.
.It Li EX_NOHOST No (68)
The log server name was not valid.
.It Li EX_NOINPUT No (67)
A command-line key file could not be opened.
.It Li EX_SOFTWARE No (70)
A successfully created public key could not be converted to external (DER) form
for storage in new log metadata,
or severe internal error.
.It Li EX_USAGE No (64)
Command line parameters are incorrect.
.It Li EX_UNAVAILABLE No (69)
A specified key length was insecure.
It was impossible to create a new key.
Other unspecified error.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -bullet
.It
To create a GDP log on a default server:
.Dl gdp-create edu.berkeley.cs.eric.log00
The secret key will be written into a a file named
.Pa KEYS/<something>.pem ,
where
.Va <something>
is the base-64-encoded internal name of the log, e.g.,
.Li 1KZy5jy1QpghTe8QBmDQGqdz3a_9tVP3qp6uxlOeJdk.pem .
The password for encrypting this key will be read from the standard input.
.It
To create a GDP log on log server named edu.berkeley.eecs.gdp-01 using defaults:
.Dl logd=edu.berkeley.eecs.gdp-01.gdplogd
.Dl gdp-create -s $logd edu.berkeley.cs.eric.log01
.It
To create a log named
.Li $newlog
on the server named
.Li $logd
encrypted with a 1024-bit RSA key,
leaving the unencrypted key in a file named
.Pa mykey.pem :
.Dl gdp-create -k RSA -b 1024 -e none -K mykey.pem $newlog
.It
To create a log with user-specified metadata:
.Dl gdp-create Qo "MYMD=My special metadata" Qc $newlog
.It
To create a log without a human-friendly name using sha-224
as the hash (message digest) algorithm:
.Dl gdp-create -h sha224
.Nm gdp-create
will print the base-64-encoded name of the new log.
You should be careful to record that,
since it is your only way to access the log.
.El
.Sh BUGS
There should be some way to provide the key password
other than reading it from the standard input.
.Pp
It should not be necessary to name the server on which the log will be created.
This command will be replaced by a smart service
that chooses placement based on locality and capacity.
