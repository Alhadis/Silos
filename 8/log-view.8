.Sh NAME

.Nd view information about an on-disk GDP log

.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
scans GDP log files (GCLs) and prints information about them.
It can only be run on the servers on which logs are actually stored,
i.e., this is a very low level diagnostic and debugging tool.
However, it does not attempt to assess log integrity and consistency;
for that, see
.Xr gdp-log-check 8 .
.Pp
If the
.Fl l
flag is given,
information about all logs hosted on the server is printed
(but see the
.Fl n
flag), and no names may be listed on the command line.
Otherwise, at least one name must be listed on the command line.
.Pp
The amount and content of the output is driven by the
.Fl v
flag.
If not set, only the names of matching logs
(that is, the base-64 encoded printable version of the internal log names)
are printed.
The
.Fl v
flag may be repeated to get additional verbosity.
If any
.Fl v
flags are given, the output is multiple lines per log.
.Pp
Details of the output format (other than with no
.Fl v
flags given) are subject to change.
