  abstract = {Background: Changing trends demonstrate that women, in several economically developed countries, are drinking at higher levels than ever before. Objective: This study applied an extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), including self-identity, to examine women's intentions to consume alcohol. Methods: Women (N = 1069) aged 18–87 years, completed a questionnaire measuring their intentions to engage in binge drinking and frequent drinking. As research indicates that drinking trends are a function of age, hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted separately for four age groups (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45, and above). Results: Results supported the predictive utility of the TPB, (particularly Attitudes and Perceived Behavioral Control). Across the age groups, the final models explained between 48% and 62% of the variance in intentions to binge drink and between 33% and 51% of the variance in intentions to drink frequently. Subjective norms were significant associated with the youngest group (18–24 years) and the oldest group (45 + years). Self-identity was significantly associated with intentions to binge drink in younger women. Conclusions: Implications are discussed with regard to the predictive utility of an extended TPB to include self-identity in determining women's intentions to consume alcohol. Key factors that influence women's decisions to engage in risky drinking behaviors have been underlined to inform future interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Self-identity is considered as a useful additional predictor in the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). However, previous research generally assessed the impact of pro-environmental self-identity in relation to single behaviours and no studies considered its potential role in moderating the impact of other predictors on behaviour. The present research used a within-persons approach to examine effects across behaviours and a longitudinal design to assess the moderating role of self-identity in the prediction of intentions and behaviours, controlling for past behaviour. Participants (N = 240) completed Time 1 questionnaires measuring TPB constructs in relation to five different pro-environmental behaviours. Two weeks later, participants (N = 220) responded to a questionnaire assessing self-reports of these behaviours during the intervening two-week period. Across pro-environmental behaviours the findings showed that pro-environmental self-identity significantly moderated the impact of perceived behavioural control on intentions and the effect of past behaviour on both intentions and behaviours.

  abstract = {This study applies the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to examine how factors in the TPB, along with personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion), need to belong, self-identity, and self-esteem relate to excessive social network sites (SNSs) use and SNSs addiction among Singaporean adolescents and adults. We conducted two nationally representative surveys of Singaporean adolescents (n = 4920) and adults (n = 1000). Results indicated that adolescents showed greater addiction to SNSs as compared to adults, and that there are key differences between how the antecedents relate to the two dependent variables. TPB variables were found to be associated with SNSs addiction only among adolescents. Neuroticism was a consistent antecedent of both excessive use and addiction in the two samples, while extraversion was related to the outcome variables only among adults. Self-identity has the strongest association with excessive use and addiction for both samples; self-esteem was negatively associated with the two dependent variables among adults. Implications for theory and practice were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  title = {Ethical food choices: Examining people’s Fair Trade purchasing decisions.},
  year = {2017/09//},
  abstract = {Fair Trade is a product certification system and social movement that aims to address global supply-chain issues such as forced labour, unsafe working conditions, and unfair pay for workers. The potential for Fair Trade to benefit producers relies directly on consumers’ decisions to support these products in their food purchasing choices. An extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used to investigate Fair Trade purchasing among a university student and community sample (N = 178). First, the reliability of the extended TPB measures was confirmed via confirmatory factor analysis. Second, a proposed model predicting people’s Fair Trade purchasing behaviour showed a good fit via structural equation modelling. The model indicated that attitude, perceived behavioural control, self-identity, and moral norm predicted intentions which, in turn, predicted fair trade purchasing behaviour. The model explained 62.6% and 40.5% of the variance in intention and behaviour, respectively. Finally, a series of MANOVAs established that the underlying TPB beliefs of ‘making me feel good’; ‘reflecting my values’, and ‘being unable to afford Fair Trade products’ distinguished between people who did and did not purchase Fair Trade products. These salient beliefs, in conjunction with the identified predictors of people’s intentions and behaviour, can be used in persuasive campaigns by those advocating socially-motivated behaviour changes in our food choices.

  __markedentry = {[marwi:2]},
  abstract = {This study aims to aid in the development of more effective healthy eating intervention strategies for pregnant women by understanding the relationship between healthy eating intention and actual eating behaviour. Specifically, the study explored whether Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) constructs [attitude, subjective-norm, perceived-behavioural-control (PBC)] and additional psychosocial variables (perceived stress, health value and self-identity as a healthy eater) are useful in explaining variance in women's 1) intentions to consume a healthy diet during pregnancy and 2) food consumption behaviour (e.g. adherence to food group recommendations) during pregnancy. A cross-sectional sample of 455 Australian pregnant women completed a TPB questionnaire as part of a larger comprehensive web-based nutrition questionnaire. Women's perceived stress, health value and self-identity as a healthy eater were also measured. Dietary intake was assessed using six-items based on the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines. Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were estimated (significance level <0.05), which explained 70% of the variance in healthy eating intention scores and 12% of the variance in adherence to food group recommendations. TPB constructs explained 66% of the total variance in healthy eating intention. Significant predictors of stronger healthy eating intention were greater PBC and subjective norm, followed by positive attitude and stronger self-identity as a healthy eater. Conversely, TPB constructs collectively explained only 3.4% of total variance in adherence to food group recommendations. These findings reveal that the TPB framework explains considerable variance in healthy eating intention during pregnancy, but explains little variance in actual food consumption behaviour. Further research is required to understand this weak relationship between healthy eating intention and behaviour during pregnancy. Alternative behavioural frameworks, particularly those that account for the automatic nature of most dietary choices, should also be considered.

Previous research had demonstrated the efficacy of TPB to predict intention and behavior in relation to food choice and the additional power of self-identity, but had failed assess the effects of self-identity while controlling for past behavior. At baseline (N = 210) TPB components and past behavior in relation to fruit and vegetable consumption plus self-identity as a healthy eater were measured by questionnaire in a sample of university students. At time 1, 4 weeks later, self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption was measured. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) indicated attitude, PBC and self-identity to be significant predictors of intention (subjective norm and past behavior were not significant). Intention, self-identity and past behavior were direct predictors of behavior. The current findings support the independent effect of self-identity as a healthy eater on both intentions and future behaviour when controlling for TPB variables and also past behavior. The discussion considers the importance of self-identity in changing intentions and behavior for behaviors such as fruit and vegetable consumption.

Much research has already addressed this hot issue; however, studies examining the intentions behind microblogging behaviors are limited. This study extended the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict intention to microblog and other behaviors. The results showed that social identity was the greatest predictor of intention, followed by attitude and perceived behavioral control.

  year = {2016/10//},
  abstract = {In China metro interruptions and casualties are largely attributable to incidents involving passengers. The present study examined metro passengers’ motivations to ride in potentially risky ways by focusing on belief-based measures of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), supplemented with several variables expected to be predictive. A survey based on this extended TPB, operationalized with respect to last-second riding, pushy riding and door-forcing scenarios, was conducted on a sample of regular passengers (N = 576, 576 and 571, respectively). In support of the TPB, after controlling for the effects of passengers’ characteristics, the behavioral, normative and control beliefs accounted for a significant part of the variance in intentions to ride dangerously as depicted in the scenarios, with behavioral beliefs and control beliefs being consistently predictive across the behaviors. The inclusion of moral norms, past behavior, perceived risk and self-identity resulted in a significant increment in explained variance for each intention investigated, with past behavior being consistently predictive while moral norms and perceived risk showing significance in some scenarios and self-identity being consistently insignificant across the behaviors. Further, an extensive set of belief targets for metro safety interventions were identified by selecting those beliefs that differed most between those who intended to commit risky riding and those who did not. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed from the perspective of reducing passengers’ risky riding tendencies.

  year = {2015/12//},
  abstract = {Purpose: To combine the identity and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) approaches to entrepreneurship, we investigated unique main effects as well as moderating effects of an entrepreneurial self-identity in the TPB-entrepreneurship framework. We also investigated predictors of an entrepreneurial self-identity. Design/methodology/approach: Considering a process model of entrepreneurship, we analyzed two cross-sectional T1 samples of German scientists with regard to two central tasks along the entrepreneurial process (business idea development and business founding) via path model analyses as well as data from follow-up surveys collected at T2 and T3 via regression analyses. Findings: Self-identity predicted founding intentions, above and beyond the effect of the TPB variables. Moreover, self-identity showed a characteristic moderating effect with TPB-intention predictors. Their effect was weaker or even zero at low levels of self-identity. In addition, self-identity forecasted behavior, but had no unique main or moderating effect on behavior in the TPB framework. Self-identity was predictable by past behavior, personality structure, recalled adolescent competencies, and early parental role models. Moreover, an engagement in entrepreneurial activity led to an increase in self-identity over time. Implications: The results suggest that self-identity operates as a motivational factor in entrepreneurial transitions that interacts with TPB variables in a characteristic way. An entrepreneurial self-identity develops from an early developmental stage on, but also during the working life. Originality/value: This study is unique because it integrates the occupational self-concept/self-identity construct into the TPB–entrepreneurship approach, and also delivers new implications concerning how to foster entrepreneurial motivations more effectively by taking the developing occupational self-concept into account.

Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs (attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy) were extended with moral norm, anticipatory regret, and donor identity. Intentions and objective plasmapheresis donation for 527 recent and 166 distant participants were assessed.Results: Multi-group analysis revealed that the model was a good fit. Moral norm and self-efficacy were positively associated while role identity (suppressed by moral norm) was negatively associated with plasmapheresis intentions.Conclusions: The extended TPB was useful in identifying factors that facilitate conversion from WB to plasmapheresis donation. A superordinate donor identity may be synonymous with WB donation and, for donors with a strong moral norm for plasmapheresis, may inhibit conversion.

Then, it analyzes the case of biofuel crops by applying an extended version of the theory of planned behavior, which includes moral norm (i.e. the personal convictions of what is wrong or right for society) and ethical self-identity (i.e. the extent to which one perceives himself/herself as an ethical person). The obtained results show that attitude and subjective norms are positively related to farmers' intention to grow biofuel crops. Yet the intention of those farmers with a higher ethical self-identity is also influenced by perceived behavioral control and moral norm. In particular, moral norm negatively affects their intention to grow biofuel crops, thus restraining the adoption of this innovation. Implications for theory, as well as for policymakers interested in promoting the diffusion of morally controversial innovations, are discussed.

  abstract = {The current study used both Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior (TPB) and Bandura’s social cognitive theory (SCT) to examine the intentions of business undergraduate students toward taking elective ethics courses and investigated the role of self-identity in this process. The study was prospective in design; data on predictors and intentions were obtained during the first collection of data, whereas the actual behavior was assessed 10 days later. Our results indicated that the TPB was a better predictor of behavioral intentions than was SCT. As expected, self-identity served as a moderator in the relationship between perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions posited by the TPB and in the relationship between outcome expectancy and behavioral intentions posited by SCT. Self-identity was a crucial factor in predicting actual behavior within both theoretical frameworks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  year = {2014/09//},
  abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to estimate the effects of a novel intervention, compared with usual chlamydia testing promotion, on chlamydia test uptake and intentions among young people living in deprived areas. The intervention was based on the theory of planned behaviour, augmented with self-identity, and targeted the significant predictors of chlamydia testing intentions identified in the previous research. Methods: Cluster randomization was used to allocate college tutor groups (intervention n = 10; control n = 11) to the intervention or control group. The sample comprised 253 participants (intervention n = 145, control n = 108). The primary outcome was test offer uptake at the end of the session. Other outcomes measured at immediate follow-up were intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and self-identity. Results: Generalized estimating equations, controlling for cluster effects and sexual activity, found a small but non-significant effect of condition on test offer uptake, OR = 1.65 (95% CI 0.70, 3.88) p = .25, with 57.5% of intervention participants accepting the offer of a test compared with 40.2% of control participants. Using the same analysis procedure, small-to-medium intervention effects were found on other outcome variables, including a significant effect on attitudes towards chlamydia testing, OR = 1.37 (95% CI 1.00, 1.87), p = .05. Conclusions: The results provide encouraging initial evidence that this theory-based intervention, targeting the key determinants of chlamydia testing, may help to improve chlamydia testing uptake in a high-risk group. They support the conduct of a larger trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

For this purpose, this study introduces an extended model of the theory of reasoned action, which embraces the emotional component (positive anticipated affection) and socially oriented value component (altruism), as predictors of ethical consumption attitude and intention. Using a questionnaire-based survey, the data were collected from 343 respondents who had previously purchased ethical products. The result showed that ethical obligation, self-identity and altruism were positively related to consumer attitude towards ethical consumption. Also, ethical obligation and altruism were found to positively influence ethical consumption intention. Further, attitude and positive-anticipated affection positively affected ethical consumption intention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine intention to participate in exercise during long-haul flights using an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB, Ajzen, 1991), augmented with the variables descriptive norm (DN) and self-identity (SI). Design: The study employed a cross-sectional design using belief-based as well as direct quantitative questionnaire measures of all variables. Method: Participants (N = 208), mean age 29.7 (SD = 11.50), were employees and students of three universities. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing the TPB predictors (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control) of intention to participate in in-flight exercise (walking and seated) and the additional variables DN and SI. Results: Regression analysis showed that all variables significantly predicted intention to engage in walking and seated exercise using direct measures. A similar pattern of results was found using belief-based measures in the context of walking. Normative beliefs did not reach significance in the belief-based model of seated exercise. Based on direct measures, the TPB accounted for 50% of the variance in intention to walk and 41% to do seated exercise after controlling for past behaviour. The additional contribution of DN was 2% for walking and 1% for seated exercise. The additional contribution of SI was 2% for walking and 2% for seated exercise. Conclusions: The results of this study support the application of TPB augmented with DN and SI in the context of walking and seated in-flight exercise. The findings can be used to aid the development of motivational strategies for health-related exercise during long-haul flight travel. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  year = {2013/12//},
  abstract = {Due to the critical shortage and continued need of blood and organ donations (ODs), research exploring similarities and differences in the motivational determinants of these behaviors is needed. In a sample of 258 university students, we used a cross-sectional design to test the utility of an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) including moral norm, self-identity and in-group altruism (family/close friends and ethnic group), to predict people’s blood and OD intentions. Overall, the extended TPB explained 77.0% and 74.6% of variance in blood and OD intentions, respectively. In regression analyses, common contributors to intentions across donation contexts were attitude, self-efficacy and self-identity. Normative influences varied with subjective norm as a significant predictor related to OD intentions but not blood donation intentions at the final step of regression analyses. Moral norm did not contribute significantly to blood or OD intentions. In-group altruism (family/close friends) was significantly related to OD intentions only in regressions. Future donation strategies should increase confidence to donate, foster a perception of self as the type of person who donates blood and/or organs, and address preferences to donate organs to in-group members only.

  year = {2013/10/01/},
  abstract = {This study examined a three-step adaptation of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) applied to the intention of consumers to purchase sustainably sourced food. The sample consisted of 137 participants, of which 109 were female, who were recruited through a farmers market and an organic produce outlet in an Australian capital city. Participants completed an online questionnaire containing the TPB scales of attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention; measures of positive moral attitude and ethical self identity; and food choice motives. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine the predictive utility of the TPB in isolation (step 1) and the TPB expanded to include the constructs of moral attitude and ethical self-identity (step 2). The results indicated the expansion of the TPB to include these constructs added significantly to the predictive model measuring intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. The third step in the adaptation utilised this expanded TPB model and added a measure of retail channel (where consumers reported buying fresh produce) and 9 food choice motives, in order to assess the predictive utility of the inclusion of choice motivations in this context. Of the 8 food choice motives examined, only health and ethical values significantly predicted intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. However, with the addition of food choice motives, ethical self-identity was no longer a significant predictor of intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. Overall the adapted TPB model explained 76% of the variance in intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This study uses the theory of reasoned action to examine how measures of subjective and indirect ambivalence affect the separation of paper and packaging for recycling. The relationships between recycling beliefs and recycling attitudes and between recycling intention and behavior are stronger for lower levels of subjective ambivalence. Indirect ambivalence moderates the relationship between ecological self-identity and recycling behavior in the same way. One exception is that the relationship between recycling intention and behavior is stronger for higher levels of indirect ambivalence. Moreover, indirect ambivalence mediates the effect of subjective ambivalence both on recycling intention and behavior. However, this mediation is imperfect, which suggests that there is a need to measure the two types of ambivalence when studying conservation practices.

  year = {2013/01//},
  abstract = {Previous research on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) is characterized by cross-sectional tests of the model's proposed causal relationships. In the absence of effective experimental techniques for changing the TPB's cognitive antecedents, the present research aimed to provide a stronger non-experimental test of the model, using causal analyses of two-wave panel data. Two studies of driver behavior were conducted in which naturally occurring within-participant changes in TPB constructs were measured over time, and used to predict corresponding within-participant changes in both intentions and behavior. A two-wave panel design was used in both studies. Study 1 had a one-month gap between baseline and follow-up. At both waves, a convenience sample comprising predominantly university students (N = 135) completed questionnaire measures of all TPB cognitions and behavior (compliance with speed limits in urban areas). Cross-lagged multiple regressions and bootstrapping procedures for testing multiple mediators supported all of the relationships proposed by the TPB. These findings were extended in study 2 using a large, non-student sample of speed limit offenders (N = 1149), a six-month gap between baseline and follow-up, and a larger number of cognitive antecedents. Participants completed postal questionnaires at both waves to measure all cognitions proposed by the two-component TPB, along with moral norm, anticipated regret, self-identity and speeding on urban roads, country roads, and fast dual carriageways or motorways. Changes in instrumental and affective attitude, descriptive norm, self-efficacy, moral norm, anticipated regret and self-identity predicted changes in intention to speed. Changes in intention and self-efficacy predicted behavior-change. Injunctive norm and perceived controllability did not predict intention or behavior-change. Additionally, direct (unhypothesized) relationships with behavior were found for affective attitude, descriptive norm and anticipated regret. The implications of the findings for theory and the development of effective behavior-change interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  year = {2012},
  abstract = {The Three-Component Model of organizational commitment (TCM) by Meyer and Allen (1991, 1997) is widely regarded as the most dominant model in organizational commitment research (Cohen, 2003, 2007). However, recent research by Solinger et al. (2008) questioned the legitimacy of the TCM as a general model of organizational commitment. More specifically, the authors criticized the TCM for grouping affective commitment as an attitude toward target with continuance and normative commitment as attitudes toward behaviors under one general label of attitudinal construct. Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980), Solinger et al. (2008) argued that we should consider organizational commitment strictly as an attitude toward the organization (i.e., affective commitment). Based on Eagly and Chaiken's (1993) composite attitude-behavior model, the current study tested the reconceptualization of organizational commitment as a unidimensional construct reflecting employees' attitudes toward the organization (i.e., affective commitment) in predicting several organizational behaviors (i.e., considerate voice, production deviance, and behavioral engagement). In addition, I also investigated whether these organizational behaviors could be better explained by adding different classes of behavioral expectancies (i.e., utilitarian, normative and self-identity expectancies) as antecedents. Finally, I tested the mediating roles of attitude toward behaviors in the relationship between affective commitment and three behavioral expectancies and the three organizational behaviors. A sample of 258 employees in a large-sized organization in China was obtained for this study. The results suggested that none of the hypotheses of the current study was supported by the evidence in the current study. In particular, affective commitment and three classes of behavioral expectancies did not significantly predict their corresponding behaviors. In addition, I also did not find the evidence for the indirect effects from affective commitment and the behavioral expectancies on the behaviors. Several alternative explanations were provided for the results. Among those, the lack of compatibility between affective commitment and the behaviors, the existence of moderators (e.g. national culture), the lack of necessary control to perform the behaviors successfully are key factors that might lead to the current findings. Although none of the hypotheses was supported, I found limited empirical supports for the reconceptualization of organizational commitment strictly as the attitude toward the organization and that organizational behaviors could be better explained by adding appropriate behavioral expectancies to the model (Solinger et al., 2008). Finally, theoretical and practical implications of the current study as well as directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The increasing popularity of motorcycles in Australia is a significant concern as motorcycle riders represent 15% of all road fatalities and an even greater proportion of serious injuries. This study assessed the psychosocial factors influencing motorcycle riders’ intentions to perform both safe and risky riding behaviours. Using an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB), motorcycle riders (n =229) from Queensland, Australia were surveyed to assess their riding attitudes, subjective norm (general and specific), perceived behavioural control (PBC), group norm, self-identity, sensation seeking, and aggression, as well as their intentions, in relation to three safe (e.g., handle my motorcycle skilfully) and three risky (e.g., bend road rules to get through traffic) riding behaviours. Although there was variability in the predictors of intention across the behaviours, results revealed that safer rider intentions were most consistently predicted by PBC, while riskier intentions were predicted by attitudes and sensation seeking. The TPB was able to explain a greater proportion of the variance for intentions to perform risky behaviours. Overall, this study has provided insight into the complexity of factors contributing to rider intentions and suggests that different practical strategies need to be adopted to facilitate safer and reduce risky rider decisions.

  abstract = {The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) plus moral norms, anticipated regret, past behaviour, self-identity and perceived susceptibility was applied to predicting motorcyclists’ intention to ride above the speed limit and ride at inappropriate speeds. Past behaviour, control beliefs, attitudes, moral norm, normative beliefs, age and self-identity explained 60% of the variance in motorcyclists’ intention to exceed the speed limit on motorways (N =1381). A total of 62% of the variance in motorcyclists’ intention to really go for it on rural roads was accounted for, with past behaviour, attitudes, control beliefs, age, normative beliefs, anticipated regret, self-identity, behavioural beliefs and training status being significant (N =1116). Finally, attitudes, past behaviour, control beliefs, moral norm, anticipated regret, behavioural beliefs, normative beliefs, engine size and self-identity explained 57% of the variance in motorcyclists’ intention to ride faster than felt safe in order to keep up with the group (N =1940). The belief-based measures also successfully differentiated between those who intended to speed and those who did not. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

  year = {2012/11//},
  abstract = {Objectives: To study whether exercise action control profiles should be usefully extended to include exercise identity. Further, this study investigated theory of planned behaviour antecedents of exercise identity. Design: Prospective data from 413 undergraduate students (M age = 21.4; 73.5% females). Method: Validated questionnaires were used at baseline and follow-up two weeks later to assess exercise behaviour, intention, self-identity, and theory of planned behaviour concepts. Research questions were analysed using chi-square analysis, discriminant function analysis and structural equation modelling. Results were interpreted using p-values and effect sizes. Results: There was a higher proportion of exercise intenders in the strong exercise identity group than in the weak exercise identity group (81.9% vs. 14.5%) and a higher proportion of successful intenders in the high exercise identity group than in the low exercise identity group (45.5% vs. 18.2%). Affective attitude and perceived behavioural control (PBC) were the most important predictors of exercise action control. Regarding the antecedents of identity, results showed significant and small-sized associations for baseline affective attitude and perceived behavioural control and large-sized association for baseline self-identity. Conclusion: Exercise identity should be usefully employed to understand exercise motivation and action control. Affective attitude and perceived behavioural control facilitate action control and exercise identity development and are suggested to be taken into account when developing exercise interventions.

  abstract = {This study examined the role of self-perceptions, within a theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework, in the prediction of householders’ recycling intentions and behavior. To examine additional self-perception constructs, the personality factor of conscientiousness (as well as its lower order facets) and measures of self-identity were assessed in addition to the standard TPB predictors of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Participants from the general community (N = 200) completed TPB, conscientiousness, and self-identity items. Two weeks later, 148 participants reported their recycling behavior for the previous fortnight. Structural equation modeling found some support for the standard TPB with attitude and subjective norm (but not PBC) predicting recycling intentions and intentions (but not PBC) predicting recycling behavior. In addition, self-identity as a recycler but not conscientiousness (or its lower order facets) emerged as a significant predictor of recycling intentions, although not as a significant determinant of actual recycling behavior. The findings of the present study highlight the importance of considering role-related perceptions in the development of prorecycling campaigns.

  title = {Habit, identity, and repetitive action: A prospective study of binge-drinking in UK students.},
  year = {2012/09//},
  abstract = {Objectives: Repeated action can lead to the formation of habits and identification as ‘the kind of person’ that performs the behaviour. This has led to the suggestion that identity-relevance is a facet of habit. This study explores conceptual overlap between habit and identity, and examines where the two constructs fit into an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model of binge-drinking among university students. Design: Prospective, questionnaire-based correlational design. Methods: A total of 167 UK university students completed baseline measures of past behaviour, self-identity, the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI), and TPB constructs. One week later, 128 participants completed a follow-up behaviour measure. Results: Factor analyses of the SRHI and four identity items revealed two correlated but distinct factors, relating to habit and identity, respectively. Hierarchical regression analyses of intention and behaviour showed that identity contributed over and above TPB constructs to the prediction of intention, whereas habit predicted behaviour directly, and interacted with intentions in predicting behaviour. Habits unexpectedly strengthened the intention–behaviour relation, such that strong intenders were more likely to binge-drink where they also had strong habits. Conclusions: Identity and habit are conceptually discrete and impact differently on binge-drinking. Findings have implications for habit theory and measurement. Recommendations for student alcohol consumption reduction initiatives are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants were 538 undergraduate students who completed measures of exercise self-identity, exercise behaviour, TPB items, and behavioural and control beliefs. Regression analysis showed that self-identity was the second strongest predictor of exercise behaviour and interacted with exercise intention. Follow-up analysis showed that the intention-exercise relationship was more than three times stronger at high than at low levels of exercise self-identity. Results also showed that only a marginal part of the sample with strong exercise identities had a weak exercise intention, whereas a large part of the sample with a strong exercise intention also reported a strong exercise identity. Nevertheless, only a quarter of the sample that reported strong exercise identity and intention were sufficiently active. The results underline the notion that exercise self-identity may be a useful component for the theory of planned behaviour. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  title = {Predicting Blood Donations Among College Students as a Strategy to Design Voluntary Blood Donation Campaigns in China.},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {The current study investigated the voluntary, safe blood donation in China using an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (including attitudes, subjective norms, descriptive norms, moral norms, self-identity, and perceived behavioral control), the Health Belief Model (HBM) (including perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and cues to action), and the Social Amplification of Risk Theory (SART) (including the concept of trust). Attitudes focus on individuals’ evaluations of the behaviors. Subjective norms (i.e., perceived social pressure to engage in the behavior), descriptive norms (i.e., individuals’ perceptions of what most people do), moral norms (i.e., personal feelings of social responsibility), and self-identity (i.e., individuals’ perceptions of their social roles) were expected to form a multidimensional higher-order concept called norms. Perceived behavioral control was hypothesized to be a second-order multidimensional construct with two components: perceived controllability (i.e., individuals’ perception that they have control over the behavior) and perceived self-efficacy (i.e., one’s confidence in his/her ability to perform the behavior). Perceived susceptibility (i.e., beliefs that a certain negative outcome will occur) and perceived severity (i.e., the evaluation about how serious the outcome could be) were proposed to converge on a higher-order construct called perceived threats. Cues to action were operationalized as the requests for blood donations from various resources (i.e., blood banks, schools, family and friends, and social groups). The concept of trust emphasized the trust in blood banks. The current study hypothesized that blood donation intentions were a positive function of attitudes toward blood donations, norms, perceived behavioral control, threats, and cues to action. Trust in blood banks was hypothesized to be positively related to attitudes toward blood donations. A panel (two-wave) survey was conducted. A convenience sample of 248 undergraduate students was recruited from a large regional university in China. The results supported the extended TPB with additional components, including descriptive norms, self-standard (moral norms and self-identity), and self-efficacy. Subjective norms, descriptive norms, and self-standard converged to create a higher order construct: Norms. The convergence in the perceived behavioral control domain (self-efficacy and controllability) and the threats domain (perceived susceptibility and severity) were not obtained. Norms and self-efficacy appeared to be two primary predictors of intentions to donate blood. The direct effects of trust in blood banks on attitudes were confirmed. The results also revealed the indirect effects of trust in blood banks on blood donations intentions. Self-efficacy and controllability predicted past blood donation frequency directly. In addition, self-efficacy mediated the effects of norms on past blood donation frequency. The HBM components (i.e., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and cues to action) appeared to be non-significant predictors of blood donation intentions and past behaviors. This study provided a theoretic basis for designing voluntary blood donation campaigns and identified the beliefs and factors that should be targeted in the future campaigns. The current study results reinforce arguments for blood donation campaigns to appeal to social responsibility. One possible method is to frame blood donation as a socially admirable behavior. In addition, the study findings indicate that future blood donation campaigns should take advantage of the effects of perceived behavioral control on both blood donation intentions and blood donation behaviors. Study results indicate the potential utility of campaign messages that include specific coping strategies such as how to reduce barriers to blood donations.

  abstract = {Differences were examined in Theory of Planned Behaviour determinants of students’ intention to smoke including parents’ attitudes towards smoking and parents’ current cigarette use among Greek students of different school grade levels. Students (N = 763) aged 10–18 years reported their attitudes towards smoking, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, self-identity and intention to smoke while their parents (N = 525) reported their attitudes towards smoking and their current cigarette use. All the TPB variables increased from lower to higher school grade level. Multisample path analyses showed that parent’s attitudes towards smoking positively predicted students’ intention to smoke only for elementary school children. Parents’ current cigarette use did not contribute significantly. Students’ attitudes, perceived behavioural control and self-identity predicted systematically intention to smoke in contrast to the subjective norm that did not contribute at all. Perceived behavioural control contributed to a higher degree in intention to smoke for senior high school students compared to the junior high school and elementary students. Self-identity contributed to a higher degree in intention to smoke for elementary compared to the junior high school students. The results of this study suggests that the determinants of smoking vary between early and late adolescence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Through nature conservation practices, farmers can strongly enhance nature quality and biodiversity in rural areas. In this paper, the social psychological underpinnings of farmers’ nature conservation practices are investigated using the Theory of Planned Behavior, to which the concepts of self-identity and personal norms were added. A distinction is made between nature conservation practices done on a non-subsidised basis and nature conservation practices for which farmers receive some form of remuneration from the Dutch government. Eighty-five arable farmers participated in our survey. Results show that our model explains more variance in the intention to perform non-subsidised than subsidised nature conservation practices. Also, the concepts of self-identity and personal norms appear to be related to the intention to perform non-subsidised, not subsidised conservation.

  year = {2011/06//},
  abstract = {Background: Although class attendance is linked to academic performance, questions remain about what determines students’ decisions to attend or miss class. Aims: In addition to the constructs of a common decision-making model, the theory of planned behaviour, the present study examined the influence of student role identity and university student (in-group) identification for predicting both the initiation and maintenance of students’ attendance at voluntary peer-assisted study sessions in a statistics subject. Sample: University students enrolled in a statistics subject were invited to complete a questionnaire at two time points across the academic semester. A total of 79 university students completed questionnaires at the first data collection point, with 46 students completing the questionnaire at the second data collection point. Method: Twice during the semester, students’ attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, student role identity, in-group identification, and intention to attend study sessions were assessed via on-line questionnaires. Objective measures of class attendance records for each half-semester (or ‘term’) were obtained. Results: Across both terms, students’ attitudes predicted their attendance intentions, with intentions predicting class attendance. Earlier in the semester, in addition to perceived behavioural control, both student role identity and in-group identification predicted students’ attendance intentions, with only role identity influencing intentions later in the semester. Conclusions: These findings highlight the possible chronology that different identity influences have in determining students’ initial and maintained attendance at voluntary sessions designed to facilitate their learning.

  title = {An extended version of the theory of planned behavour: Prediction of intentions to quit smoking using past behaviour as moderator.},
  year = {2010/10//},
  abstract = {It was hypothesised that: (i) intentions to quit smoking were predictable from group identity, self-identity, moral norms and past quit attempts, beyond the components of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and (ii) that past experiences with the behaviour (quit attempts) would increase the predictive utility of the extended TPB model on intentions. The data was collected among 357 daily smoking students (M = 24 years). The TPB components accounted for 12.3% of the variance in quitting intentions, while the extension variables added 16.5% to the explained variance in intentions beyond the impact of the TPB. Past behaviour had the strongest impact on intentions (a = 0.30), followed by moral norms (a = 0.25), perceived behavioural control (PBC, a = 0.20), attitude (a = 0.18) and group commitment (a = -0.11). By splitting the sample into three categories of past quit attempts the picture changed, revealing that the predictive utility of the TPB increased with the number of quit attempts (no past quit attempt, R² = 1%, ns and several past quit attempts, R² = 12.3%, p < 0.001). Moreover, PBC and group commitment were significantly stronger predictors of intention among those who had several previous quit attempts compared with those who never had tried to quit smoking. The extended TPB model explained 1% and 28% of the variance in intentions among those with no and several previous quit attempts, respectively. The practical implications of these results for the development of interventions to encourage smokers to quit smoking are outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Policymakers are interested in cost-effective and socially acceptable ways of encouraging the public to adopt more environmentally-friendly lifestyles. One area which UK policymakers are focussing on is ‘catalyst behavior’, the notion that taking-up a new behavior (such as recycling) may cause people to adopt other pro-environmental behaviors. Yet, evidence for such ‘spill-over’ effects is so far limited, and it is unclear when and how cross-situational motivations (e.g., pro-environmental identity) may predict behavior and when contextual factors are more important. We report on a postal survey (N = 551) of pro-environmental behaviors amongst the UK public. We assess the influence of pro-environmental self-identify on consistency across a range of behaviors. Pro-environmental values, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, attitudes, and demographic factors were also measured. Findings show self-identity to be a significant behavioral determinant over and above theory of planned behavior variables for carbon offsetting behavior. However, pro-environmental self-identity was only a significant predictor for certain other pro-environmental behaviors; background variables were also important predictors. Limitations of the study, and implications for theory and policy, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Factors predicting high-level mobile phone use and relations between self- and prototypical identity are investigated by using an extended version of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A total of 215 Austrian university students participated by completing two questionnaires, 1 week apart. The first questionnaire assessed attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and intention as well as self- and prototypical identity variables. The second questionnaire assessed mobile phone use in the previous week. It was found that all three TPB variables significantly predicted intention. The addition of identity variables improved the model with self-identity becoming the second strongest overall predictor. In terms of predicting high-level mobile phone behavior, intention and subjective norm, but not PBC, were significant predictors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In an attempt to rectify this situation, the present study explored the psychological antecedents of heterosexuals’ pro-gay activism behavior in an undergraduate sample using the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991). Findings suggest that intentions predict activism behavior (in the form of signing an online petition supporting the construction of a new lesbian, gay, and bisexual resource center on their campus). In addition, attitudes toward the possible outcomes of the behavior, attitudes toward the behavior itself, and self-identity were found to predict intentions. Directions for future research on pro-gay activism are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  year = {2010/06//},
  abstract = {In an effort to contribute to greater understanding of norms and identity in the theory of planned behaviour, an extended model was used to predict residential kerbside recycling, with self-identity, personal norms, neighbourhood identification, and injunctive and descriptive social norms as additional predictors. Data from a field study (N=527) using questionnaire measures of predictor variables and an observational measure of recycling behaviour supported the theory. Intentions predicted behaviour, while attitudes, perceived control, and the personal norm predicted intention to recycle. The interaction between neighbourhood identification and injunctive social norms in turn predicted personal norms. Self-identity and the descriptive social norm significantly added to the original theory in predicting intentions as well as behaviour directly. A replication survey on the self-reported recycling behaviours of a random residential sample (N=264) supported the model obtained previously. These findings offer a useful extension of the theory of planned behaviour and some practicable suggestions for pro-recycling interventions. It may be productive to appeal to self-identity by making people feel like recyclers, and to stimulate both injunctive and descriptive norms in the neighbourhood.

  year = {2010/05//},
  abstract = {Objectives: To explore whether people’s organ donation consent decisions occur via a reasoned and/or social reaction pathway. Design: We examined prospectively students’ and community members’ decisions to register consent on a donor register and discuss organ donation wishes with family. Method: Participants completed items assessing theory of planned behaviour (TPB; attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control (PBC)), prototype/willingness model (PWM; donor prototype favourability/similarity, past behaviour), and proposed additional influences (moral norm, self-identity, recipient prototypes) for registering (N = 339) and discussing (N = 315) intentions/willingness. Participants self-reported their registering (N = 177) and discussing (N = 166) behaviour 1 month later. The utility of the (1) TPB, (2) PWM, (3) augmented TPB with PWM, and (4) augmented TPB with PWM and extensions was tested using structural equation modelling for registering and discussing intentions/willingness, and logistic regression for behaviour. Results: While the TPB proved a more parsimonious model, fit indices suggested that the other proposed models offered viable options, explaining greater variance in communication intentions/willingness. The TPB, augmented TPB with PWM, and extended augmented TPB with PWM best explained registering and discussing decisions. The proposed and revised PWM also proved an adequate fit for discussing decisions. Respondents with stronger intentions (and PBC for registering) had a higher likelihood of registering and discussing. Conclusions: People’s decisions to communicate donation wishes may be better explained via a reasoned pathway (especially for registering); however, discussing involves more reactive elements. The role of moral norm, self-identity, and prototypes as influences predicting communication decisions were highlighted also. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This study sought to identify cognitive predictors of motorcyclists’ intentions to speed using a model that comprised selected constructs from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), supplemented with constructs from identity theory and social identity theory. Participants (N =110) were sampled from motorcycle clubs in Scotland and they completed web-based questionnaire measures of all cognitive variables, operationalized with respect to speeding on both 30 mph urban roads and 70 mph dual carriageways and motorways. In support of the TPB element of the model, affective attitude and perceived controllability accounted for significant variance in intention to speed on each road type. The identity constructs accounted for additional variance in intentions to speed on 70 mph roads. The significant independent predictors of speeding intentions on 30 mph roads were affective attitude and perceived controllability. For 70 mph roads, the independent predictors of intention were affective attitude, self-identity, perceived group norm, group identification, and an interaction between perceived group norm and group identification. Consistent with predictions derived from social identity theory, decomposition of the interaction showed that perceived group norm had an increasing effect on intention with increases in group identification. Implications for theory development and safety interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing popularity of social networking Web sites (SNWs), very little is known about the psychosocial variables that predict people’s use of these Web sites. The present study used an extended model of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), including the additional variables of self-identity and belongingness, to predict high-level SNW use intentions and behavior in a sample of young people ages 17 to 24 years. Additional analayses examined the impact of self-identity and belongingness on young people’s addictive tendencies toward SNWs. University students (N = 233) completed measures of the standard TPB constructs (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control), the additional predictor variables (self-identity and belongingness), demographic variables (age, gender, and past behavior), and addictive tendencies. One week later, they reported their engagement in high-level SNW use during the previous week. Regression analyses partially supported the TPB: attitude and subjective norm signficantly predicted intentions to engage in highlevel SNW use with intention signficantly predicting behavior. Self-identity, but not belongingness, signficantly contributed to the prediction of intention and, unexpectedly, behavior. Past behavior also signficantly predicted intention and behavior. Self-identity and belongingness signficantly predicted addictive tendencies toward SNWs. Overall, the present study revealed that high-level SNW use is influenced by attitudinal, normative, and self-identity factors, findings that can be used to inform strategies that aim to modify young people’s high levels of use or addictive tendencies for SNWs.

  year = {2009/12//},
  abstract = {This study explored the role of donor prototype evaluations (perceptions of the typical organ donor) in organ donation communication decisions using an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model. The model incorporated attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, moral norm, self-identity, and donor prototype evaluations to predict intentions to record consent on an organ donor register and discuss the organ donation decision with significant others. Participants completed surveys assessing the extended TPB constructs related to registering (n = 359) and discussing (n = 282). Results supported a role for donor prototype evaluations in predicting discussing intentions only. Both extended TPB structural equation models were a good fit to the data, accounting for 74 and 76% of the variance in registering and discussing intentions, respectively. Participants’ self-reported discussing behaviour (but not registering behaviour given low numbers of behavioural performers) was assessed 4 weeks later, with discussing intention as the only significant predictor of behaviour (Nagelkerke R² = 0.11). These findings highlight the impact of people's perceptions of a typical donor on their decisions to discuss their organ donation preference, assisting our understanding of the factors influencing individuals' communication processes in efforts to bridge the gap between organ supply and demand.

  year = {2009/09//},
  abstract = {Objective: To examine the effect of two types of self-identity on attempts to quit smoking: self-identity in terms of smoking and self-identity in terms of quitting. Design: A prospective survey among an initial sample of 3,411 smokers. Smoking history variables and psychosocial variables from the theory of planned behavior are also measured. Main Outcome Measures: Intention to quit smoking and smoking cessation attempts 4 months later. Results: Both smoking identity and quitting identity matter, but they appear to play different roles in explaining intention to quit and in predicting actual attempts to quit. Quitting identity is particularly important for intention to quit, whereas both quitting identity and smoking identity are important for actually trying to quit. Recent attempts to quit slightly attenuate the negative effect of smoking identity on attempts to quit. Conclusion: A broader interpretation of self-identity in terms of both current and aspired behavior offers a better understanding of when people might change health-relevant behavior.

First year students and participants of a students of sustainability conference (n = 169) were administered a questionnaire survey that measured standard TPB constructs as well as environmental group membership and self-identity as an environmental activist. Consistent with predictions, environmental group membership and self-identity were positive predictors of intentions. Thus, greater involvement in environmental groups and a stronger sense of the self as an environmental activist were associated with stronger intentions to engage in environmental activism. There was also evidence that self-identity was a stronger predictor of intentions for participants with low rather than high environmental group membership. In accordance with the standard TPB model, participants with more positive attitudes toward and a greater sense of normative support for environmental activism also had greater intentions to engage in the behaviour. The implications for groups seeking to harness support for activities to protect the environment are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

A model containing the TPB, additional variables and demographic factors provided a good prediction of both intention (R² = 0.72; attitude, perceived behavioural control, moral norm and self-identity significant predictors) and behaviour--breastfeeding at birth (88.6% correctly classified; household deprivation, intention, attitude significant), at discharge from hospital (87.3% correctly classified; intention, attitude significant), 10 days after discharge (83.1% correctly classified; education, intention, attitude, descriptive norm significant) and 6 weeks after discharge (78.0% correctly classified; age, household deprivation, ethnicity, moral norm significant). Implications for interventions are discussed, such as the potential usefulness of targeting descriptive norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC) when attempting to increase breastfeeding uptake.

  abstract = {Few studies have examined the predictors of breast self-examination in younger women, where it is the primary method for the early detection of breast cancer. Female college students (N = 253, aged 17 to 50 years) completed items related to breast self-examination assessing theory of planned behaviour (TPB) constructs (intentions, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control), social influence variables of self-identity and group norm, and demographic characteristics. One month later, breast self-examination behaviour was assessed. Results supported this application of the TPB model and highlight the importance of group norms for strategies to increase breast self-examination in younger women.

The authors used a revised set of role-identity items to capture the personal and social aspects of role identity within a specific behavioral context. At the commencement of the semester, the authors assessed the students' attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, role identity, and intention. The authors examined the students' class attendance records 3 months later. Attitudes and perceived behavioral control predicted intention, with intention as the sole predictor of attendance. Role identity also predicted intention, reflecting the importance of the student role identity in influencing decision making related to supplementary academic activities.

One week after completion of the main questionnaire, participants completed a follow-up questionnaire that assessed self-reported physical activity during the previous week. The standard TPB variables--past behavior, self-identity, and group norms, but not social support influences--predicted intentions, with intention, past behavior, and self-identity predicting behavior. Overall, the results provide support for an extended version of the TPB incorporating self-identity and those social influences linked explicitly to membership of a behaviorally relevant reference group.

An extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) including a wider array of identity and social influences is developed and tested. As hypothesized, self-identity expressiveness and social identity expressiveness prove to be significant determinants of intentions to use. Moreover, the extended TPB model explains 62% of the variance in usage intentions. ,The paper also investigates the relationship between self identity expressiveness and attitude and between social identity expressiveness and subjective norm. The study results indicate that the concept of subjective norm alone is insufficient to capture the rich universe of identity and social influences driving behavioral intentions.

  abstract = {The present study was designed to examine the predictive utility of planned behavior theory to the multicultural education domain. One hundred and forty-eight students in early childhood studies (146 women, 2 men; M age = 21.8 yr., SD = 2.6) were asked to complete a questionnaire based on planned behavior theory to measure attitudes toward teaching multicultural classes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and self-identity. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the planned behavior model components explained 52.5% of the students' intentions. Addition of self-identity increased the amount of variance accounted for by the model (57.3%). It was concluded that researchers may have increased confidence when applying the planned behavior theoretical framework to study prospective educators' attitudes, and that self-identity seems to represent a useful explanatory variable.

  abstract = {This study explores the potential contribution of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to our understanding of student teachers' strength of intention to teach dance prior to and following an intensive eight-hour module before beginning their school-based practice. Students attending a primary Postgraduate Certificate in Education Course (PGCE) (n=89) were identified as 'intending strongly' or 'not intending' to teach dance. They then completed a questionnaire designed to measure their behavioural beliefs, their normative beliefs and their control beliefs in accordance with Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour. They were also questioned about their feelings of self-efficacy and self-identity as prospective teachers of dance and about their perceived barriers to teaching dance effectively. The questionnaire was re-administered at the completion of the intensive dance course. Initially, no significant difference was found between the strength of behavioural beliefs, attitude and self-efficacy of intenders and non-intenders (p<.01), but a difference was found in the level of normative beliefs. Following the dance course a significant positive shift (p<.05) was shown in the intentions of the non-intenders. Significant positive relationships were found between most variables, apart from perceived behavioural control. Taken as a whole the combined contribution of these variables accounted for 32.9% of the variance in intention to teach dance, and multiple regression analysis indicated that the model was a highly significant predictor of intention. Some implications of these findings for dance teacher training are proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In addition, past behaviour (PB), moral norms, self-identity as a smoker, group identification, group norms and action planning were assessed. A prospective sample of 145 adolescents (M = 14 years, Time 1) participated in the study. The TPB provided good predictions of intentions (adjusted R² = 0.28). An extended TPB model including self-identity, moral norms, and the group identification and group norm interaction accounted for 39% (adjusted R²) of the variance in intentions. The TPB components did not have a direct impact on subsequent behaviour, while PB and the perceived behavioural control (PBC) intention interaction accounted for 35% of the variance in behaviour after one year. The practical implications of these results for the development of interventions to encourage adolescent smokers to reduce or quit smoking are outlined.

  abstract = {Two studies addressed the hypothesis that a minority of people are more oriented towards their self-identity when forming intentions to act than the traditional antecedents of intentional action; attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC). In Study 1, participants (N=241) completed measures of an augmented version of theory of planned behaviour (TPB) that included self-identity for 30 behaviours. Using within-participants multiple regression analyses, the sample was classified into self-identity-oriented (SI-oriented) and TPB-oriented groups. Between-participants multiple regression analyses revealed that self-identity was a significantly stronger predictor of intentions and accounted for significantly more incremental variance in intentions in the SI-oriented sample compared with the TPB-oriented sample across the 30 behaviours. In Study 2, participants (N=250) completed the same TPB and self-identity measures used in Study 1 as well as measures of generalized self-concept and social physique anxiety for dieting behaviour. Results indicated that self-identity was significantly associated with the generalized self-related measures, and self-concept and social physique anxiety moderated the self-identity-intention relationship. This investigation provides some preliminary evidence to support the effect of individual differences in self-identity on the formation of intentions to act.

  abstract = {This study examined behavior toward genetically modified (GM) food in a British community-based sample. We used an equivalent gain task in which participants actually received the options they chose to encourage truthful responding. In conjunction with this, theory of planned behavior (TPB) components were evaluated so as to examine the relative importance of behavioral influences in this domain. Here, the TPB was extended to include additional components to measure self-identity, moral norms, and emotional involvement. Results indicated that the monetary amounts participants accepted in preference to GM food were significantly lower than those accepted in preference to non-GM food. However, the vast majority of participants were indifferent between GM and non-GM food options. All TPB components significantly predicted behavioral intentions to try GM food, with attitudes toward GM being the strongest predictor. Self-identity and emotional involvement were also found to be significant predictors of behavioral intentions but moral norms were not. In addition, behavioral intentions significantly predicted behavior; however, PBC did not. An additional measure of participants' propensity to respond in a socially desirable manner indicated that our results were not influenced by self-presentation issues, giving confidence to our findings. Overall, it appears that the majority of participants (74.5%) would purchase GM food at some price. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A questionnaire to measure components of the theory, and the Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Activity measuring exercise habits, were administered. The intervention lasted 12 wk. and included posters and lectures promoting participation in physical activity. Analyses showed the intervention was effective in improving attitudes towards physical activity, perceived behavioral control, intention, and self-reported actual behavior, but it was ineffective for improving attitude strength, subjective norms, and role identity.

  abstract = {The objective of the study was to test the effectiveness of an intervention program based on the theoretical framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior, with the addition of attitude strength and role identity. The aim was to alter adolescents' healthy eating attitudes and behaviour. In the sample were 335 high school students, who were divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention lasted 12 weeks and included posters and lectures promoting healthy eating. The measures included a questionnaire assessing the hypothesis and a food frequency questionnaire which measured eating habits. Analysis showed the intervention was effective in improving attitudes toward healthy eating and attitude strength, intention, perceived behavioral control, and healthy eating behaviour, but not effective in predicting subjective norms and role identity. Results provide evidence that intervention changed attitudes toward a behavior in a school setting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  year = {2005/06//},
  abstract = {Background: Concerns about direct-to-consumer advertisement's (DTCA's) information quality have raised interest in patients' drug information-seeking after DTCA exposure. Objective: To identify predictors of patients' intentions and behaviors to seek drug information from physicians, pharmacists, and the Internet after DTCA exposure, using theories of planned behavior and self-efficacy. Methods: One thousand patients were randomly selected from 3,000 nationwide osteoarthritic patients. A self-administered survey examined predictors of intention including measurements of attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, perceived difficulty, self-efficacy, controllability, self-identity, intention, exposure to ads, and control variables. After 6 weeks, another survey measured respondents' information-seeking behavior. For patients exposed to DTCA, 6 multiple regressions were performed for information-seeking intention and behavior for 3 information sources: physicians, pharmacists, and the Internet. Results: The response rates were 61.9% and 80.1% for the first survey and the second survey, respectively. Four hundred and fifty-four participants reported exposure to DTCA about arthritis prescription medicines in the previous month. Over 41% of the variance in intention and over 18% of the variance in behavior were explained by the regression procedures. The consistent positive predictors of intention were attitude toward behavior, self-identity, attitude toward DTCAs of arthritis medication, and osteoarthritis pain; while the consistent positive predictors of behavior were intention and osteoarthritis pain. The strongest predictors of intention were self-identity for physicians, subjective norm for pharmacists, and attitude toward behavior for the Internet. Perceived difficulty and self-efficacy did not predict intention, and self-efficacy and controllability did not predict behavior. Conclusions: DTCA-prompted drug information-seeking may be under patients' complete volitional control. To promote information searching, efforts could be made to affect factors predicting intention. Interventions could address patients' attitude toward behavior, the influence of their important others, and their role as information seeker, respectively, for information sources like the Internet, pharmacists, and physicians.

  abstract = {This study examined the ability of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict students' intentions to quit smoking and the subsequent behavior 6 months later. In addition, the impact of past behavior, moral norms, self-identity, group identity, and positive/ negative anticipated affect was examined. The intention-behavior relationship was examined by dividing the sample in four subgroups: inclined actors/abstainers and disinclined actors/abstainers. Analyses were based on data from a prospective sample of 698 smokers. Attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control accounted for 36% (adjusted R²) of the variance in intentions. Moral norms, positive anticipated affect, group identity, and past behavior added 9% (adjusted R²) to the explained variance in intention, beyond the effect accounted for by the TPB components. Subsequent behavior was predicted by intentions (adjusted R² = .12). Past behavior, moral norms, self-identity, and the Past Behavior × Intention and Moral Norm × Negative Affect interactions explained an additional 9% (adjusted R²) of the variance in behavior. Inclined abstainers constituted the main source of the discrepancy between intention and behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

An Ajzen and Fishbein-type questionnaire was administered to 100 undergraduate students at the University of Ulster, Coleraine. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis provided strong support for the role of self-efficacy as a major determinant of intention. It not only helped to explain some 73% of the variance, but also made a greater contribution to the prediction of intention than the other main independent variables of the model--past behaviour and self-identity. Demonstrating the utility of self-efficacy in the context of blood donor behaviour not only has several important practical implications, but serves to further highlight its importance within the TPB.

In addition, the sufficiency of the TPB was assessed by examining the additional predictive utility of moral norms, anticipated affect and self-identity. A sample of 1833 adolescents completed a questionnaire containing a scenario depicting a potentially hazardous road-crossing behaviour, followed by items measuring the TPB constructs, moral norms, anticipated affect and self-identity. Regression analyses revealed that the TPB was able to explain 25% of the variance in road-crossing intentions, over and above the influence of age and gender, with perceived behavioural control emerging as the strongest predictor. The additional variables were found to increase the predictive utility of the TPB. The results have a number of theoretical and practical implications. In particular, interventions should focus on perceptions of control in order to encourage safer road-crossing behaviour among adolescents.

  abstract = {This study identifies the nature, strength and relative importance of influences on intentions to purchase genetically modified (GM) food. Drawing upon contemporary attitude-behavior research, a model is developed of intention to purchase GM food. The model is a modification of the Theory of Planned Behavior 1991) with self-identity as an additional determinant of intention. Also included in the model are a number of factors hypothesized as having relationships with the determinant components of the model, including prior purchasing based on concern for the environment and concern for personal health. Survey questions were developed using focus groups. 266 participants completed the survey. Key findings were that self-identity, attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were all significant in determining intention. In addition, these determinants were distinguished in terms of their relationships with age, gender, prior behavior, and the believability of statements by companies engaged in GM food production. Changes in intention given the nature of its determinants are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Reports 2 studies designed to test a theory of planned behavior-based model of blood donation. In Study 1 (n=136; aged 14-50 yrs), self-efficacy and self-identity accounted for unique variance in behavioral intention. Study 2 (n=172; aged 14-63 yrs) extended Study 1: self-efficacy, perceived control over behavior (PCB), self-identity, and moral norm were all independently predictive of intention; behavioral intention predicted a proxy measure of behavioral inaction. Both studies provided evidence to support a distinction between self-efficacy and PCB, and for the inclusion of self-identity and moral norm into the model. Belief-based measures discriminated intenders from nonintenders, and beliefs that accounted for unique variance in self-efficacy and PCB were identified. The findings are discussed in relation to using models such as the theory of planned behavior to intervene (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Students (N=384) who were or were not intoxicated with alcohol completed measures based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in relation to having casual sex in a scenario. The scenario described sex between 2 individuals not in a relationship and manipulated the consumption of alcohol of the sexual partners and availability of condoms. The data were supportive of the TPB: Intentions were predictable from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Results also support the inclusion of measures of past behavior and anticipated affective reactions, but not self-identity or moral norms as predictors of intentions. Alcohol in the scenario and condom availability increased intentions to have sex. There were also several interaction effects. Implications for using the TPB to understand sexual behaviors under the influence of alcohol are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The present study predicts adults' intention to eat healthily, using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and additive and moderating effects of role identity, group norms and group identification, derived from identity theory and self categorization theory. A total of 735 25-yr-old adults participated in a mailed questionnaire survey in 1997. The TPB explained 52% of the variance in young adults' decision to eat healthily, with perceived behavioral control and subjective norms being the strongest and weakest determinants, respectively. Although role identity accounted for an additional amount of 4% of the variance in behavioral intention, past behavior did not moderate the impact of role identity on intention, as hypothesized. Neither perceived group norm nor group identification added to the prediction of intention over and above the TPB. However, group identification was found to act as a moderator on the relation between group norm and behavioral intention in the predicted direction. The wider social context seems to play a stronger role for the formation of adults' healthy eating decisions than indicated by the TPB. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The study was conducted in the northern district (Woreda 10) of Addis Ababa City, Ethiopia and administered to 354 sexually active female adolescents. Results supported the validity of the TPB model, with subjective norm as the strongest predictor of intention. In addition, self-identity, and past behavior emerged as significant predictors of intention in the augmented model. Moreover, a moderation effect was observed for past behavior on self-identity-intention relations, the significance of which was confirmed by simple slope analysis. Based on the findings, the possibility of integrating the self-identity perspective within the TPB is suggested. Further theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

The study was concerned with the prediction of intention to engage in household recycling and reported recycling behavior. 143 community residents (aged 17–59 yrs) participated in the study. It was prospective in design: measures of the predictors and intention were obtained at the 1st wave of data collection, whereas behavior was assessed 2 wks later. Self-identity significantly predicted behavior intention, a relationship that was not dependent on the extent to which the behavior had been performed in the past. As expected, there was also evidence that the perceived norm of a behaviorally relevant reference group was related to behavioral intention, but only for participants who identified strongly with the group, whereas the relationship between perceived behavioral control (a personal factor) and intention was strongest for low identifiers.

Following criticism of the use of questionnaires in social cognitive research, the impact of questionnaire format (random vs structured) and social desirability on questionnaire responses was assessed. The 110 participants (aged 14–67 yrs) were a sample of the general population from a large city in the North of the United Kingdom. Findings indicate that intention was the principal determinant of food choice: attitude, subjective norm, and self-identity were independently predictive of intention. There was only weak evidence to suggest effects of social desirability or questionnaire format on component relationships. The study indicates that the impact of questionnaire format and social desirability on models such as the theory of planned behaviour is minimal, and that such models are robust predictors of food choice.

The TPB provided good predictions of both intentions (attitude, injunctive norms, and perceived behavioural control [PBC] were significant) and behaviour (intentions were significant). Other norm measures (descriptive and injunctive norms [social norms and peer pressure, respectively]) explained additional variance in intentions. In addition, habit strength and self-identity explained significant additional portions of the variance in intentions, but not behaviour, over and above the TPB variables. Several interactions among these variables were also tested. Attitude moderated the impact of PBC on intentions. Moral norms moderated the impact of attitudes on intentions. Habit strength moderated the impact of self-identity on intentions. PBC was found to moderate the impact of intentions on behaviour. The findings are discussed in relation to how interaction effects further the understanding of the social processes by which variables are related in the TPB.

  abstract = {The theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour continue to receive considerable research attention, despite criticisms of their 'asocial' conceptualisation and the rational decision-making approach. Two studies were designed to assess the impact of induced mood (using J. M. H. Williams's [1984] modified version of E. Velten's [1968] mood-induction procedure) on condom use (Study 1) and food choice (Study 2). Both studies, comprising male and female 18–41 yr olds, provided support for application of the theory of reasoned action to health-related behaviour, and for differential effects of mood on information processing. Study 1 provided support for problem-focus theory, with attitudes (but not subjective norm) predicting intention in the negative mood condition. The opposite pattern of findings held for the positive mood condition (i.e., only subjective norm predicted intention). The results of Study 2 provided further support for the problem-focus approach and for the inclusion of self identity in the theory of planned behaviour.

  year = {1999/03//},
  abstract = {The theory of planned behavior (TPB) has received considerable attention in the literature. However, there have been few attempts to assess the proposed causal links between beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behavior. The present study was designed to assess the predictive validity and causal ordering of TPB constructs over a 3-mo period in hospital workers (aged 20–64 yrs). Findings indicate good internal and test-retest reliability of assessed components; evidence for a distinction between two processes of perceived behavioral control (self-efficacy and perceived control); support for inclusion of self-identity into the model; and predictive validity of the TPB over 3 mo. Perhaps more importantly, there was some evidence to support causal ordering between predicted TPB variables. In particular, cross-lagged panel correlation analysis supported the causal impact of self-efficacy on intention. This study supports the use of the TPB as a reliable predictor of intentions and behavior over time on a repeated behavior (food choice). It also highlights the need for further research on the relationship between attitudes, perceived behavioral control and their underlying beliefs.

  year = {1999/01//},
  abstract = {[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 39(8) of Journal of Applied Social Psychology (see record [rid]2009-11666-013[/rid]). There was an error in Table 1. The means (standard deviations) for the last outcome belief measures ('Not eating a low-fat diet would make me feel guilty'), should have been -0.24 (1.97) for intenders, and -1.82 (1.57) for non-intenders. The corrected version of the table is given in the erratum.] The aims of the present study are fourfold: to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to eating a low-fat diet; to consider differences between self-efficacy and perceived control over behavior (PCB); to examine self-identity as a potential addition to the model; and to identify beliefs which may provide useful targets for interventions. Findings support the efficacy of the TPB as a predictor of low-fat diet. Evidence for the distinction between self-efficacy and PCB was provided by principal components analysis, patterns in prediction of intention, and the control beliefs associated with the two constructs. Self-identity was found to independently predict intention and may prove a useful addition to the TPB. Finally, specific beliefs distinguished intenders from nonintenders, providing potential targets for health interventions. The findings are discussed in the context of previous TPB research and the need for multimethod assessments of behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  year = {1998/12//},
  abstract = {This paper reports a study applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to the prediction of pedestrians' road crossing intentions. 210 pedestrians (aged 17–75 yrs) completed questionnaires which included scenarios of 3 potentially dangerous road crossing behaviors, followed by measures of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, self-identity and intention. Results indicate that the social psychological variables under consideration were able to explain 39–52% of the variance in intentions to cross the road in the manner depicted in the scenarios. The perceived behavioral control component of the TPB emerged as the strongest predictor of pedestrians' intentions, suggesting that perceptions of control have an important role to play in road safety behavior. Results are discussed in relation to the predictive utility of the TPB in this area and possible interventions to encourage safe road crossing behavior.

  abstract = {Discusses evidence for the inclusion of a measure of self-identity within the structure of the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behavior (TPB), reports research which assessed the independence of its predictive effects, and outlines reasons for these effects. Self-identity is interpreted as synonymous with self-perception or self-concept, thus, social identities are subsumed as particular kinds of self identity. 235 Ss completed a questionnaire addressing the consumption of a diet low in animal fats. The questionnaire was structured in terms of the TPB and contained additional variables that previous research has indicated to be useful predictors of intentions and behavior. A multiple regression of intentions showed self-identification as a health-conscious consumer to have a predictive effect independent of the effects of these other variables. This effect was also found in replication studies. Results show that the main study along with the 2 replication studies (in Finland and Denmark) provide evidence for predictive effects of a measure of self identity in applications of the TPB. It is concluded that these results strengthen the case for examining self identity in applications of the TRA and TPB, especially those that involve health related behaviors.

An extension to the theory was also included, in the form of a 'self-identity' measure, assessing identification with concern about the health consequences of diet. 612 Ss (under 18 yrs of age) completed a questionnaire that incorporated the central components of the planned behavior theory, along with questions relating to the assessment of unrealistic optimism. The findings indicate some support for the applicability of the theory of planned behavior, with the measure of 'self-identity' producing some additional independent effects. Evidence of unrealistic optimism concerning diet-related health risks was found, with greater optimism being significantly related to lower relative consumption estimates of 'unhealthy' foods.

Six variables were measured: intention, attitudes toward teaching, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, role identity, and attitude strength. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that the role identity and attitude strength variables mediated the effects of subjective norms and attitudes toward behavior on Ss' intentions. Also, perceived behavioral control was not a direct determinant of intention, but affected attitude strength. Results suggest that professionals' intentions to work with individuals with disabilities are formed as part of their role identity in the society and are affected by professionals' attitude confidence toward teaching individuals with disabilities.

Two additional variables, multicomponent attitude strength and role identity, were constructed to expand the initial PLB model. The participation of 395 women (aged 18–45 yrs) in physical fitness programs over a 2-mo period served as a behavioral criterion. Attitudes toward behavior, perceived behavioral control, role identity, and attitude strength predicted intention to exercise. Also, exercise behavior was predicted from intention, perceived behavioral control, role identity, and attitude strength. Perceived behavioral control was a more accurate predictor of behavior than intention. Also, the PLB model was slightly more successful in predicting exercise behavior when attitude strength and role identity were added to the analysis.

Contrary to expectations, regression analyses showed a substantial independent effect for self-identity; this effect persisted when a measure of past consumption was included in the regression equation. Findings are discussed in relation to the expected-utility origins of the theory of planned behavior and to the range of considerations taken into account when people express their attitudes via the standard questionnaire measures employed in research of this kind.

Fishbein's (1963, 1980) theory of reasoned action, the level of consistency between intention and behavior was very high in both nations. Among those whose intentions is not compatible with their self-identity and their prior behavior, however, the intention–behavior relationship weakened considerably. A modification to Fishbein's model is offered in which prior behavior and self-identity have both a direct and an indirect effect on behavior through behavioral intention.
