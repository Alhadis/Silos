//This function is used to reward a party with xp for an action, describe why the xp was given, and set a variable so it is only given once for the action.
// Inputs are:  sGotEntry = The name of the Local Variable,
//              oPCGotEntry = the PC that called this function (speaker, chest opener, etc)
//              nXPToGive = xp for each party member
//              sTextMessage = Message to display, telling why xp was given

//    while (GetIsObjectValid(oPartyMember) == TRUE) // While there are more members in the party
//  {
//    QuestAwardXP(oPartyMember,nXPToGive); //Give xp to each member
//    SOS_SetPersistentInt(oPartyMember,sGotEntry,1);  // Sets a local variable in case you want to check for it (i.e. give the bonus once only)
//    FloatingTextStringOnCreature(sTextMessage, oPartyMember, TRUE); //Tell the player what the xp was for with a string above his PC's head
//    oPartyMember = GetNextFactionMember(oPCGotEntry, TRUE); // Find next party member
